I'm Changyeon Jo, a system software engineer at MangoBoost.
At MangoBoost, I'm mainly working on RDMA-related DPU software stack. (e.g., device drivers, SPDK, ...)
Before joining MangoBoost, I was a staff engineer at Samsung Electronics.

I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Seoul National University in 2021 and a BS in Computer Science from Hanyang University ERICA in 2012.
Throughout my Ph.D. study, I worked on software-based memory disaggregation techniques, performance modeling of VM live migration using machine learning, and efficient VM live migration techniques.
